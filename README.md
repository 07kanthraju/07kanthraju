## Current Project

### 📄 DocPort — Doctor-First Insurance Integration Platform  
🔗 https://github.com/07kanthraju/DocPort

**DocPort** is a unified platform that simplifies OPD integration between doctors and multiple insurance providers.

Doctors manage their profile, availability, and appointments through a single system, while insurance providers integrate once via standardized APIs. The platform reduces redundant onboarding, improves operational efficiency, and keeps control with the practitioner.

**Focus areas**
- Backend service design
- API-based insurer integrations
- Secure data handling
- Cloud-native deployment
- CI/CD automation

This is my primary active project.
