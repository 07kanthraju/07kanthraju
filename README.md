## Current Project

### 📄 DocPort — Doctor-First Insurance Integration Platform  
🔗 https://github.com/07kanthraju/DocPort

**DocPort** is a unified platform that simplifies OPD integration between doctors and multiple insurance providers.

Doctors manage their profile, availability, and appointments through a single system, while insurance providers integrate once via standardized APIs. The platform reduces redundant onboarding, improves operational efficiency, and keeps control with the practitioner.

### Designa is a design-driven code synthesis engine.
🔗 https://github.com/07kanthraju/Designa.git

It compiles structured low-level design files into validated source code using AI with strict scope control, deterministic validation, and human review.
Design becomes the source of truth.
Generated code becomes a build artifact.
